    "We assume that the price of a stock follows the geometric Brownian motion process described by Black-Scholes-Merton. The stock has a starting price $S_0$. The risk-free interest rate $r$ represent the time value of money. Stock volatility $\\sigma$ describes how quickly the stock price moves. The call option is an option to buy at a strike price $K$ expiring at time $T$. The price at time $T$ is given by $S=S_0 e^{(r-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T + \\sigma \\sqrt{T} Z}$, where $Z$ is a random variable that has a standard normal distribution (mean zero, variance one).\n",

    "For our example, let's assume the stock price is currently 100 USD, and we have the option to buy the stock at 105 USD in 3 months. The annual volatility of the stock is 40%, and the risk-free rate is 3%.\n",

Since we are using a Monte Carlo appproach, however, we will want $n$ simulations. In a language like Java or C++, a typical approach might be to call <code>bsm</code> $N$ times.
